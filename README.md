`NOTE`: I have primary worked with NoSQL.

### Running the server

```sh
# makes use of prisma
pnpm start:dev
# makes use of prisma
pnpm start:dev:prisma
# makes use of drizzle
pnpm start:drizzle
# makes use of native postgres
pnpm start:native
```

# Trade API Performance Testing

### Stress Testing

`NOTE`: Mark the route GET /trades as public using the `@Public` decorator.

I tried to stress test with prisma, drizzle and native postgres. For which I stress tested with staged testing, basically increasing load and traditional way with 1Lakh rows in trades table. My findings as follows for fetching all trades:

<details>
<summary>1Ô∏è. GET /trades - Prisma: with rawQuery gave the best performance</summary>

<details>
<summary>Without staged testing: </summary>

2. GET /trades - Native Postgres: was comparable with prisma rawQuery but saw failures with increasing concurrency
3. GET /trades - Drizzle: has almost double the time when compared to prisma raw query
4. GET /trades - Prisma: without rawQuery has the worst time

## ORM Implementation Comparison

This project includes three different ORM implementations for the Trade APIs:

1. **Prisma ORM**
2. **Drizzle ORM**
3. **Native PostgreSQL**

### Running Performance Tests

You can run stress tests with different ORM implementations using the following commands:

```bash
# Run tests with specific implementation
pnpm stress:prisma
pnpm stress:drizzle
pnpm stress:native
```

The test results will be saved in the `results` directory:

- Individual results: `stress-test-results-{orm}.json`
- Comparison report: `comparison-report.json`

### Switching ORM Implementation

The active ORM implementation can be switched using the `ORM_TYPE` environment variable:

```bash
pnpm start:dev:prisma  # Use Prisma ORM
pnpm start:dev:drizzle # Use Drizzle ORM
pnpm start:dev:native  # Use Native PostgreSQL
```

### Implementation Details

Each ORM implementation follows the Repository pattern and implements the same interface:

```typescript
interface ITradeRepository {
  findAll(params: {
    type?: string;
    userId?: string;
  }): Promise<{Trade[]}>;

  findById(id: string): Promise<Trade | null>;

  create(data: ITradeRequest): Promise<Trade>;
}
```

This allows for easy comparison between different implementations while maintaining consistent behavior across the application.
